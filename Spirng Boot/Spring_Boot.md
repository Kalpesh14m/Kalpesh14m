Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can "just run".

We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need minimal Spring configuration.

---

## Features

- Create stand-alone Spring applications

- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow directly (no need to deploy WAR files)

- Provide opinionated 'starter' dependencies to simplify your build configuration

- Automatically configure Spring and 3rd party libraries whenever possible

- Provide production-ready features such as metrics, health checks, and externalized configuration

- Absolutely no code generation and no requirement for XML configuration
