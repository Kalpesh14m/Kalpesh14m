# Angular :man_technologist:	:computer:

Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps.


## Install the Angular CLI

You use the Angular CLI to create projects, generate application and library code, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

### To install the Angular CLI, open a terminal window and run the following command:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

---

### Create a workspace and initial application

You develop apps in the context of an Angular workspace.

To create a new workspace and initial starter app:

- Run the CLI command ng new and provide the name my-app, as shown here:

` ng new my-app`

The `ng new` command prompts you for information about features to include in the initial app. Accept the defaults by pressing the Enter or Return key.

The Angular CLI installs the necessary Angular npm packages and other dependencies. This can take a few minutes.

The CLI creates a new workspace and a simple Welcome app, ready to run.

---

### You also have the option to use Angular's strict mode, which can help you write better, more maintainable code. For more information, see Strict mode.
Run the application

The Angular CLI includes a server, so that you can build and serve your app locally.

- Navigate to the workspace folder, such as my-app.

Run the following command:

```
cd my-app
ng serve --open
```

The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

The --open (or just -o) option automatically opens your browser to `http://localhost:4200/`.

If your installation and setup was successful, you should see a page similar to the following.
